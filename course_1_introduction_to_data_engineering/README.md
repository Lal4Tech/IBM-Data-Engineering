# Introdcution to Data Engineering

## Modern Data Ecosystem and Role of Data Engineering

The value we derive from data depends on:

- Accuracy of data
- Accessibility of data when we need it

A modern data ecosystem includes whole network of **interconnected**, **independent** and **continually evolving** entities.

It involves:

- Data integrated from disparate sources.
- Different types of analysis and skills to generate insights.
- Active stakeholders to collaborate and act on insights generated.
- Tools, applications and infrastructure to store, process and disseminate data as required.

Data sources:

- Structured
- Unstructured

When working with many data sources,

- The first step is to pull a copy of data from the original sources into a data repository. At this stage, we look at only
  - Acquiring the data we need
  - Working with data formats, sources and interfaces through which data can be pulled.
  - *Challenges*: reliability, security and integrity of the data.
- Once the data is in common place(Enterprice data repository)
  - Raw data needs to be organized, cleaned up, optimized for access
  - Conform to compliances and standards enforced in the organization.
  - *Challenges*: Data management, repositories that provide high availability, flexibiliy, accessibiliy and security.
- Finally, Business stakeholders, Applications, programmers, analysts, data science use cases all pulling the data from Enterprice data repository.
  - *Challenges*: Interfaces, APIs, Applications that can get this data to the end users in line with their specific needs.

Emerging technologies shaping the modern data ecosystem:

  - Cloud technologies
  - Machine Learning
  - Big Data
